    <div id="myID"> <p> For our first assignemnt, we went over the basics of coding. 
        In doing so, I created my own unique picture of spiraling circles.</p>

    <div id="myID"> <p>For our second coding assignment, we had to creat a short game, 
        or story with the Scratch coding website. I made a short story with the Princess the Frog storyline.

    <br/>
    <div id="myID"> <p> For our third assignment, we were to create a short game that could be played with the CODE website. 
        My game was an avoidance game. If the characters touched you, you lost.</p>

    <br/>
    <div id="myID"> <p>For our fourth assignemnt, we used the Alice coding program. With this, I created a funny gag video
        of a call to the Nemo movie.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div id="myID"> <p> For our fifth assignment, we began to work with p5.js program. I made a portrait of mysef using the
        tools to create shapes.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div id="myID"> <p> For our sixth assignment, we continued to work with p5.js program. I made  certain shapes within my portrait
        to start moving around the screen.
    </p>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div id="myID"> <p> For our seventh assignment, we continued to work with p5.js program. We were instructed to create a game.
        I made my another avoidance game with your character, and added a maze to give the player a bigger challenge. The trainagles
        moved around the board and bounced back on the edges.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div id="myID"> <p> For our eigth assignment, we continued to work with p5.js program. We developed our coding within the game to become simpler. 
        I also added more enemies that chnaged colors and moved around the screen.
