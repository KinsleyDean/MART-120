A GUI is a visual based way to interact with any computer. It consists of how most people get around their computers. 
There are visual things to click, and these can lead to pop ups with other options to do within the computer. 
Each option is usually seperate from the rest, and takes you to seperate things to do. 
These options usually consist of visual menus, folders, icons and windows.
I prefer this interface better becuase I am a very visual learner and having something to see makes it easier for me.

A CLI is a text based way to interact with youre computer. The user must have basic coding knowledge in order to perform with it. 
It is used for "quicker manipulation of files and directories". Instead of clicking little boxes to navigate the computer options, 
you type out what you want the compuer to do. An advantage of CLI shows more information all in one place.
I had a very hard time trying to figure out how to use this interface, It just didnt make sense to me very much,
and I think further instruction in a video would be better benifical for me.

*if this is not long enough, please let me know and I will fix it! Thank you
